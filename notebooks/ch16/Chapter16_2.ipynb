The intention of showcasing this functionality is to illustrate the concept of feature stores and what they can bring to ML production work, rather than focusing specifically on this implementation of a feature store."],"metadata":{"application/vnd.databricks.v1+cell":{"title":"","showTitle":false,"inputWidgets":{},"nuid":"59de2566-966b-4c67-b6e3-5c46e2f572c4"}}},{"cell_type":"code","source":["%pip
